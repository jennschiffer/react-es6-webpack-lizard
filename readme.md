# jenn learns react & es6 & webpack & stylus all together lol

after almost a year of not writing much javascript for app development (hi php pals) i decided to dive into react for the first time. over the weekend i watched all of [wes bos's "react for beginners" videos](https://reactforbeginners.com/). i also read about webpack and figured i take what i learned and get a "hello world" app set up with both. also i noticed today that most of my coworkers have been using stylus so i threw that in here too. while i was at it, i dove into some es6 (or as brendan eich once told me to call it, javascript 2015) and therefore used babel here.

i still have questions about why things are done one way and not the other, and i'm going to create some issues in this repo to get those discussions started (btw if you're not nice i will delete your contributions immediately).

also i have to say that to make this "hello world" app took several hours to do. like, i struggled mostly with getting webpack to play nice with react and stylus. i literally have a headache right now, but it was still a fun challenge. a big challenge for a pretty seasoned programmer nonetheless.
